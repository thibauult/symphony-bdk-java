## How to use
The central component for the Message API is the `StreamService` class.
This class exposes the user-friendly service APIs which serve all the services mentioned above
and is accessible from the `SymphonyBdk` object by calling the `streams()` method:
```java
@Slf4j
public class Example {
  public static final String STREAM_ID = "MY_STRING_UD";

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    // Create BDK entry point
    final SymphonyBdk bdk = new SymphonyBdk(loadFromClasspath("/config.yaml"));

    // Get stream details
    StreamService streams = bdk.streams();
    V2StreamAttributes stream = streams.getStream(STREAM_ID);
    log.info("Stream details: " + stream);
  }
}
```
