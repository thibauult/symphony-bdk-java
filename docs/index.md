# Symphony BDK Reference Documentation

>
> ### BDK version 3.0: Major change !
> 
> The newly introduced BDK version 3.0 relies on Java 17 and SpringBoot 3. This is a major change that allows Symphony to continue to propose the latest security fixes following the end of support of Spring Boot 2 and also to keep up with the latest evolutions of Java.
> 
> For the next 6 months Symphony will provide critical security fixes for BDK 2.0 where possible (since Spring gives no guarantees for their packages).
> 
> Please consider migrating your Bots in the coming months to benefit from the latest features and support. 
>
>> ### Note !
>> As detailed above, the BDK version 2.0 will stop being supported by Symphony on August 15.
